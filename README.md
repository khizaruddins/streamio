# Streamio

Streamio is a react redux based client app which has similar functionality as twitch live streaming app has

RTMP server is used to create live streaming video server which communicates with client react streamio app

Google OAuth2 client based login system is implemented

User can create see and edit delete their streams and can play other streams created by other users.

learned about:

react react-redux react-router-dom redux redux-thunk lodash flv axios etc...

For api server I used simple json-server for running REST apis

RTMP Server uses node-media-server package for running its tasks.
